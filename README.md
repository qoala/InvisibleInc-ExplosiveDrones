# Explosive Drones
### A mod for "Invisible Inc." by KLEI Entertainment

Installs proximity-trigger explosives on unarmed drones, because we can.

* When an active agent and an explosive drone are on the same tile, the drone explodes dealing lethal damage to the
  target and itself.
* Null drones are more expensive, so come armed with an electric discharge that deals KO+EMP damage.
* After an explosive drone is destroyed (by its armament or otherwise), a replacement is dutifully delivered to the
  guard elevator.
* Proximity explosives produce a loud (8-tile) noise. Proximity discharges produce an EMP-pack-equivalent (4-tile)
  noise.
* Explosive drones with a vision range "overwatch" targets before attempting to impact them on the next corporation
  turn. This includes pausing like other guards when they find an agent around a corner.
* Pulse drones investigate their own scan results on the next corporation turn. Without vision to perform overwatch,
  they'll happily follow a path that moves into an agent they were unaware of.
* Both of these pauses can be disabled from campaign options.

Can also be applied to AGP's search drones, but not OMNIdrones. The weapons and modified AI only work for small drones
that can pass through other units.
